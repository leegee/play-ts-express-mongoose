# Playing with Mongoose through Express

## Synopsis

  npm test

## To Do

* `_id` to `id`
* Sanitise input
* Import Mongoose `Error.ValidationError`
* Swagger/OAS validation will turn on when the OAS is written - see `WIP-open-api-spec.yml`
* Hide internally-useful errors (atm all) when NODE_ENV==='production'
* Tests should tidy-up after themselves
